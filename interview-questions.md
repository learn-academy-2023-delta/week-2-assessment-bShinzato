# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is within an argument and can be named anything to be called upon later. An argument takes in parameters or given variables that are invoked within the function.

Researched answer: A parameter is a variable(s) in a function that are defined when the function is declared. In other words, a parameter is a placeholder variable that is defined inside the parentheses of the function expression. An argument are the actual values of a variable(s) that gets passed to a function.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: In the built-in method .map() the predefined parameters are: value, index, array. The value is required while the other two are optional to use.

Researched answer: In the built-in method .map() the parameter names are arbitrary but the order in which is the same. In an higher-order function, it needs to take at least one argument which is value. The two other parameters are index and array which shows the index of the array at the current interation and the array that the higher-order function was called on. Both are optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: the difference between map and filter is that, map is great for modifying or displaying each value in an array. Also map returns the same length of the original array. In contrast, filter returns a new subsetted array with values that we need.

Researched answer: Map will modify or doing something to each item in an array and return a new array of the same length. In contrast, filter will make a decision, due to an evaluation, about each item in an array. It will return a subset of an array based on if the values satisfy the stated condition.

1. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is doing something over and over again until a condition is met.

Researched answer: Iteration is the process of performing a specific action a certain number of times or until a condition is met. One common form of iteration is a for loop. 

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: A function is a block of code that perform performs something, and a method is a behavior that belongs to an object. The difference is that a method belongs to an object. 

Researched answer: The difference between a function and a method is that; a method is a function or behavior that belongs to an object. It has a function attached to a key, and uses .this to create a variable accessing a value within the object. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Hoisting is bad practice to use, according to my instructors. For that, never really looked into it. If I could give an educated guess, probably has to with the style of code, not thoroughly readable of variables, functions, etc.

Researched answer: Hoisting is process of moving the delcaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code. Hoisting leads to confusion of the code and makes it difficult to make sense of. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: It is a type of function that can contain javascript logic and returns markup that gets rendered to the broswer. In addition, independent and reusable bits of code. It returns JSX elements and is in the container of script.

2. Spread operator: The spread operator is very useful. Allows for a quick copy of an array or object. The notation (...) indicates to copy all parts of an existing array or object.

3. React state: State is a special variable that stores data and can decide how the component renders and behaves. Thus, a components state can change over time and can re-render that component.

4. React props: The props refer to properties of an object. It passes data into read-only components. Props can only be passed in one direction between the parent and child component. They get passed down to nested components, and we can use functional props to pass information up.

5. DOM events: The Document Object Model events are the interaction with the user and website. Ranging from clicking with their mouse, hovering over hyperlinks, or typing. All these interactions are an DOM event.
